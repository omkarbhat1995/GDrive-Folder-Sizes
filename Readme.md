In Google Colab, create a new notebook, click on the "Files" icon in the left sidebar, and "Mount Drive". You will need to authenticate the Google Drive File Stream to access your Google account, and copy the authentication token into the Colab notebook.
All the folder sizes will be saved in "all.txt". Note that the -h option (as opposed to -sh) displays sub-folders. Then, "G\t" is the string which is searched for (a capital G, followed by a tab), and that line is printed. That isolates the folders which are at least 1GB large. (You could use "M\t" for folders with a megabyte size.) These largest folders are stored in "GB.txt".
